SternX
======

SternX is a command-line utility for generating report from a given JSON data. It is designed to be fast and efficient, and can process large datasets in an asynchronous way.

Usage
-----

To use SternX, simply run the `SternXcompiler.sh` script in the directory of SternX/SternX . This will compile the necessary files and generate a binary file that you can use to run SternX.

Once you have generated the binary file, you can run it by executing `./SternX` in the terminal.
